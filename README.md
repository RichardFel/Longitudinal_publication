# GRIP_Human_Activity_Patterns
Reliability of Activity Patterns measured with Accelerometers in Chronic Pain Patients

## 📖 Overview

The **GRIP project** (beweeGsensoren voor mensen met chRonIsche Pijn) aims to develop robust machine-learning models that classify **real-world activity intensities** using wrist-worn accelerometers in people with Chronic Pain (CP).

Because activity behaviour in CP differs from healthy individuals, and because labeled data is limited, this repository provides a complete, reproducible pipeline for:

- Processing accelerometer data with a trained model
- Transfrom activity patterns into characteristics
- Determine the ICC values per day

This repository contains all scripts necessary to reproduce the results for the referenced publication.
